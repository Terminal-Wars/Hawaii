# Hawaii

A basic IRC server forked from [ThomasHabets/goircd](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/goircd) with support for the battle/games features that Terminal Wars needs. [Named after Hawaii Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbtsZJXnzFY).

Do note that this project is not concerned with being IRC complient.
